**Summary:**

Passionate WEB Architect with rich Java full-stack background. I'm focused to follow the best practices in software development and share more with my team.

I wrupped up several java projects from scratch as well as digged in legacy projects to implement all the required from business needs.

Good in unix, networking and shell scripting, experienced in TLS and SSL stuff, I may adjust any kind of environment or CI for the team.

As an engineer, I'm excited in measuring things, and seeding the value onto progect's backlog. I'm experienced in scalable, highly available and high load systems with sweet and lightweight JS front-end.

I prefer distributed and lightweight microservices more than monolithic application servers.

I prefer agile prctices and commitment by all means. Have successfully throw in the codegen tool (Swagger) onto one of my project, that decrease development time cost over 30%. 

Having experience in mentoring and scrum mastering of the distributed multilingual agile team (Egypt, Georgia, US, India)
