**Personal Statement**

I am a passionate WEB Developer with rich full-stack background in Java. I'm focused to follow the best practices in software development and share more with my team. I wrapped up several java projects from scratch as well as dug in legacy projects to implement all the required business needs.

As an engineer, I'm excited about measuring things, and seeding the value onto project's backlog. I'm experienced in scalable, highly available, and high-load systems with sweet and lightweight WEB front-end.

I’m good in Unix, networking, and shell scripting, experience in TLS and SSL stuff, I may adjust any kind of environment or CI for the team. Architecturally I prefer distributed and lightweight microservices more than monolithic application servers because of the performance that may be achieved by horisontal scaling.

Other than that I’m experienced in leading, mentoring and scrum mastering the distributed multilingual agile team.
