In univercity right after graduation at Donetsk in 2006 I became a Junior Scientist at Ukrainian State Scientific Research Surveyor Institute. My diploma project was about collection and analysis of geophysical data; Measurements of electrical, seismic, magnetic waves reflected from terrestrial bodies. Namelly predicting of the violations in the rock mass, determination the structure of the medium by the measured characteristics of an electric field. 

In case of anyone is having interest on ot we did few publications of this researches:
